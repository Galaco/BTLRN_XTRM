# BTLRN_XTRM
A small platformer game written as a university assignment circa. 2013.

## Features
* Multiple levels, including support for custom levels
* Basica graphical configs
* Highscores table
* Some enemies and powerups


## Building
This project is compilable for Windows and Mac OS. Linux support is untested.

#### Windows
Visual Studio 2013 project is available for Windows. Probably requires no setup, just open the .sln and away you go.

#### Mac OS
Recommend first installing SFML 2.5 via Brew, as that will place the libs in the relevant place. A VSCode project & build configuration is available; so open the project in VSCode and compile.
